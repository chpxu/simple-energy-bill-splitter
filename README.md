Simple energy bill splitter written in plain ES6 JavaScript

## Usage

1. Simply enter your values into each box.
2. Choose your splitting method
3. Input any further details
4. Press Calculate!

Event Listener based, so will need to update input boxes (e.g. by changing options or focusing etc) before pressing "Calculate!". I will have to improve eventlistener quality, and the design of the tool, but it is functional

## Development

Very minimal, all you need is a code editor and a browser.
